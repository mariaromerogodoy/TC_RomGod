        Long before Pokemon, panini stickers, or pack-cracking YouTube videos,
        there were playing cards. Their origin isn’t 100% certain, but scholars
        generally agree that playing cards evolved in China sometime during or
        after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). One often-cited early reference is
        from the year 868, when a Tang dynasty record mentions a “leaf game”
        played by a princess. Although that reference is vague, it suggests that
        leaf-style paper “cards” or tokens were used in games. Over time,
        variations of these leaf cards may have functioned like “play money” or
        as game tokens in gambling contexts, eventually evolving into more
        structured suits and values. From China, cards seem to have spread
        westward through trade routes, contacts in Persia, India, and the
        Islamic world, eventually reaching Egypt. By the medieval era, the
        Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt had decks with suits like polo sticks, coins,
        swords, and cups. One notable surviving Mamluk-style deck was discovered
        in the Topkapı Palace, believed to date to the 15th century. Those decks
        likely influenced the European development of playing cards. The first
        reliable mention of playing cards in Europe appears around 1371 in
        Catalonia (Spain), in a rhyme dictionary referencing “naip” (a word for
        cards). By the late 1300s and early 1400s, multiple European cities
        issued bans or regulations on card games, suggesting playing cards were
        spreading and gaining popularity. As cards became more common in Europe,
        their designs evolved. The Latin suits (cups, coins, swords, batons)
        survived in southern European decks (Italy, Spain), while German and
        Swiss regions used suits like leaves, bells, hearts, and acorns. The
        French eventually simplified the designs into the now-familiar hearts,
        diamonds, clubs, and spades around the 15th century, which made mass
        production easier. Mrs Blackwell’s Village Bookshop. Innovations like
        reversible court cards (so that the king or queen is upright whichever
        way you hold the card) and corner indexing (printing the value in
        corners so you can fan the cards) came later (from the 18th to 19th
        centuries). In the 1600s and onward, guilds and formal “makers of
        playing cards” were established in cities like London. For example, in
        1628, the Mystery of Makers of Playing Cards of the City of London
        obtained a royal charter. Over the centuries, improvements in paper,
        printing, coatings, and mass production techniques made playing cards
        cheaper, more durable, and widely accessible. That’s the story of
        playing cards in general. But how did we get from those traditional
        decks to the world of trading cards like Pokémon and companies like
        Topps and Panini? Let’s follow that thread.
